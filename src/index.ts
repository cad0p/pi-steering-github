 * pi-steering-github — GitHub workflow rules for pi-steering.
 *
 * The "every PR must have at least one attached issue" policy for gh
 * CLI workflows, plus the napkin-vault body-file policy for PR and
 * issue bodies. Ported from the live prototype that ran in the global
 * pi-steering config (first live validation 2026-08-14, pi-steering
 * PR #46 session: create gate fired, agent complied in 7s) and shaped
 * after the pi-steering-flags precedent — the first official external
 * plugin:
 *
 *   - Package name: `pi-steering-<domain>` mirroring
 *     `@cad0p/pi-steering` core.
 *   - PeerDep on `@cad0p/pi-steering`; runtime dep on
 *     `@cad0p/pi-napkin` (the `./steering` subpath ships compiled JS
 *     since 0.7.0-20260814.0, so plain-node tests work).
 *   - One predicate exported as a `Plugin`; the rules, the pattern
 *     constants, and the arg helpers re-exported for unit tests and
 *     `when.condition` escape-hatch use.
 *
 * The plugin ships six rules, all STRICT (no `noOverride: false` —
 * the schema defaults fail-closed, so the policy is unconditional):
 *
 *   - `pr-body-from-vault-file`      — PR bodies come from vault
 *                                      body files under `<repo>/prs/`.
 *   - `pr-create-needs-issue-link`   — closing keyword + `#N` in
 *                                      BOTH title and body.
 *   - `pr-merge-needs-closing-keywords` — closing keyword + `#N` in
 *                                      the `--subject` value (`--help`/
 *                                      `--version`/GitHub `-h` read-only
 *                                      introspection never blocks).
 *   - `issue-body-from-vault-file`   — issue bodies come from vault
 *                                      body files under `<repo>/issues/`.
 *   - `gh-repo-create-needs-seed`    — `gh repo create|new` must
 *                                      carry a seed flag; a bare
 *                                      create births an EMPTY repo.
 *
 *   - `gh-repo-flag-before-subcommand` — an invocation carrying
 *                                      `-R x/y` into a gated
 *                                      `pr|issue …` mutation targets
 *                                      a FOREIGN repo — redirect
 *                                      (foreign subagent maintainer
 *                                      loop).
 *
 * See this package's README for usage examples and the per-rule
 * rationale, and the pi-steering README "Writing plugins" section for
 * the design rationale.
 *
 * `declare global` lives here (alongside the plugin definition) so
 * `import "@cad0p/pi-steering-github"` pulls the registry
 * augmentation in transitively — `when: { missingVaultBodyFile: … }`
 * typechecks in user configs without a separate type-only import.
 *
 * Layout mirrors the canonical `examples/work-item-plugin` shape
 * (ADR §15): the per-item rule / predicate / helper files live in
 * `./rules/`, `./predicates/`, `./helpers/`, and THIS module is the
 * single assembly point — it deep-imports the per-item files, builds
 * the `rules` roster (order = first-match-wins, see below) and the
 * plugin object, and re-exports the public surface.
