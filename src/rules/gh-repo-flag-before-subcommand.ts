 * `gh-repo-flag-before-subcommand` — a gated `pr|issue …` mutation
 * carrying `-R/--repo` targets a FOREIGN repo and must be redirected
 * to the foreign repo's own config: run a foreign subagent
 * maintainer loop until good, then cd into the foreign repo and
 * target it from there. This is the ENTRY step of the foreign flow —
 * FIRST in the roster: its `subcommand:` set OVERLAPS the pr/issue
 * body/create/merge sets (every gated subcommand routes here in ANY
 * flag position — both `-R` positions since #39, unbounded leading
 * pairs since #41, now structural via the descriptor's consuming-flag
 * arity instead of the retired `LEADING_FLAG_PAIRS` shape router),
 * so correctness rests on the evaluator's first-firing-rule-wins
 * ordering plus RELEASE FALL-THROUGH — the `foreignRepoTarget`
 * predicate releases every command without a foreign target and the
 * per-subcommand rules evaluate normally — not on subcommand
 * disjointness.
 *
 * Fires on `pr create|new|edit|merge` and `issue create|edit` only
 * (`repo create|new` is excluded by design — nothing to cd into, the
 * target is the positional argument; that exclusion is about THIS
 * foreign gate only and is NOT a policy bypass: the seed rule gates
 * repo-create forms. Read-only forms stay allowed).
 * Repo-targeting is decided by PRESENCE of `-R/--repo` (#39): absent
 * → release (fall-through); present-but-unparsable → fail-closed
 * block; slashless `-R upstream` → release (fork remote-name form).
 *
 * Fully declarative gate — zero condition code (issue #36). The
 * `subcommand:` leaf routes, two leaves compose as an AND of
 * independent registered predicates:
 *
 * - `not.infoOnly({ extraFlags: ["-h"] })` exempts read-only
 *   introspection: the flags plugin's `--help`/`--version` defaults
 *   PLUS GitHub's additive `-h` (token-level, quote-aware — quoted
 *   values can't falsely exempt). Accepted exposure: a gated
 *   invocation carrying `--version` (bare or attached) is now
 *   ALLOWED — gh errors on it for pr/issue subcommands, so nothing
 *   real can happen; `-v` is NOT in the default set and stays
 *   gated.
 * - `foreignRepoTarget: true` — this package's registered
 *   predicate: blocks when the effective `-R`/`--repo` target is a
 *   FOREIGN repo. The basename compare is hardcoded policy (#19):
 *   basename equality allows the fork→upstream contribution flow
 *   (`gh -R upstream/foo pr create` from the `me/foo` clone); cost
 *   accepted: `-R <own-repo> pr merge` from inside the repo is
 *   indistinguishable and slips through — heuristic discipline, not
 *   security. Fail-closed: unknown cwd / unresolvable repo /
 *   unparsable target → block.
 *
 * AND-of-leaves order-independence (confirmed during #23):
 * help/version invocations short-circuit ALLOW via the not-leaf
 * without consulting the predicate — byte-equivalent to the old
 * early-return ordering. A `--help` inside a QUOTED VALUE
 * (`--subject "see --help"`) does NOT exempt a real gated command
 * (token-level walker argv underneath both leaves).
 *
 * Reason is a `ReasonFn` — the plugin's first dynamic reason: the
 * redirect text renders from the RESOLVED `-R/--repo` target (the
 * single source of truth shared with the predicate; unparsable
 * targets get an honest fallback phrase — as-typed echo fidelity
 * was deliberately dropped with the mirror scan it required).
 *
 * Strict — no override (schema default).
