/**
 * `issue-body-from-vault-file` — issue bodies must come from a vault
 * note, uploaded through the same pinned perl substitution (create
 * and edit): `--body-file
 * <(perl -0777 -pe '<BODY_STRIP>' <vault-file>)`. Direct
 * paths (verbatim upload) and inline `--body` are blocked. The path
 * argument is additionally validated (see `missingVaultBodyFile`):
 * it must resolve to a real file inside a napkin vault under
 * `<repo>/issues/`. No keyword requirement (issues close nothing).
 * The anchor matches ANY leading-flag position (#41, shared
 * `LEADING_FLAG_PAIRS` unit) — a gate-released flag-first form lands
 * here instead of bypassing the policy.
 *
 * Strict — no override (schema default).
 *
 * Since #43 the `reason` is a dynamic `ReasonFn` (same shared
 * diagnostic as `pr-body-from-vault-file` — both rules consume the
 * SAME `explainBodyFileArg` tag + `renderBodyFileDiff` helper, so
 * the byte-diff format can never drift between them). Since #50
 * every other blocked stage renders mirror + trace + slotted recipe
 * from the shared `diagnose()` struct (same struct as the verdict).
