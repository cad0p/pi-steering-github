 * `pr-body-from-vault-file` — PR bodies must come from a vault note,
 * uploaded through the pinned perl substitution (create, new, and
 * edit): `--body-file <(perl -0777 -pe '<BODY_STRIP>' <vault-file>)`
 * — the one-liner strips the YAML frontmatter and the leading H1
 * (the note title, redundant under the gh PR title) before `gh`
 * uploads the content. Direct paths (verbatim upload) and
 * inline `--body` are blocked. The path argument is additionally
 * validated (see `missingVaultBodyFile`): it must resolve to a real
 * file inside a napkin vault under `<repo>/prs/`. The
 * closing-keyword content check belongs to `pr-create-needs-issue-link`.
 *
 * Routes on `command: "gh"` + the `subcommand:` sequences — ANY
 * leading-flag position is structural now (the descriptor's
 * consuming-flag arity keeps `gh --hostname h pr create …` routed;
 * pre-#41 a flag-first form released by the foreign gate bypassed
 * this policy entirely, now it lands here).
 *
 * Strict — no override (schema default).
 *
 * Since #43 the `reason` is a dynamic `ReasonFn` (schema:
 * `reason: (ctx) => string | Promise<string>`, errors replaced by
 * the evaluator's fail-safe fallback): a `--body-file` substitution
 * whose inner command deviates from the pinned one-liner now carries
 * a byte-exact diagnostic (the divergent core spans with the byte
 * offset, or the two full command lines) before the canonical static
 * recipe. Since #50 every other blocked stage renders mirror + trace
 * + slotted recipe from the shared `diagnose()` struct — the
 * predicate and this reason consume the SAME struct, so verdict and
 * message never drift.
